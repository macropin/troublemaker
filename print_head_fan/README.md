## Print Head Fan

The original parts do not positively hold the magnet in place.

So this is a minor redesign of the part to positively hold the magnet so that
it does not fall out.

### Improvements

- Easily adjust size for optimal tolerance
- Magnet is positively located and restrained
- Optional version with two fans for symetric cooling.

### Printing

Print face down with support.
